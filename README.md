#### By Bridget Njoki Githinji
## Description
This web application is designed to help a user check the type of triangle he or she has depending on the user's input.The program validates whether the three sides input can form any of the three types of trinagles:Equilateral,isosceles or scalene.However, when the user's values don't pass any of the checks,the program will inform you the dimensions used can't form a triangle.
## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Fork https://github.com/Bridget03/Triangle-Tracker
* Clone the link above
* Open the repository where the link is saved in
## BDD
* If side a is equal to side b and is equal to side c, then the application returns an Equilateral triangle.
* If side a is equal to side b but not equal to side c, then the application returns an Isosceles triangle.
* If side a is not equal to side b and is still not equal to side c but the sum of any of the two sides is less than or equal to the third one, then the application retruns a Scalene Triangle. 
* If none of the conditions is satisfied, then the application returns No Triangle.
## Technologies Used
