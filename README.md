#### By Bridget Njoki Githinji
## Description
This web application is designed to help a user check the type of triangle he or she has depending on the user's input.The program validates whether the three sides input can form any of the three types of trinagles:Equilateral,isosceles or scalene.However, when the user's values don't pass any of the checks,the program will inform you the dimensions used can't form a triangle.

##BDD
 |INPUT                     | BEHAVIOUR                 | OUTPUT
 |side a = side b = side c  |  All sides are equal      |   Equilateral Triangle
 |side a = side b != side c | Two sides are equal       |   Isosceles Triangle
 |side a != side b != side c     | No side is equal but the sum                         | Scalene Triangle
 |but side a + side b <= side c | of two sides is less than or equal to the third side |
